# what is this

this is a little side-project i started with a friend
to build this, open the sln and compile under 32bit and debug
the libraries can be rebuilt under your own time if you don't trust them lol (compile those under x86 debug as well)


#commands
js_eval("[js stuff]"); - execute javascript code in the global context
js_exec("[path to file]"); - execute .js file in the global context (not in builds yet)
